# railway-reservation-system
In this project, i have implemented Python at the front-end and PyQt5 module for GUI designing. It does provides facilities to Register user with the system, to book a seat in a particular coach, to update the user details, and finally to print a receipt of a booked ticket. Users are allowed to book multiple seats in a single coach.The seats which are already been booked by the other users will not be available/visible to the other users.

Required databases file is also included.
